# Latest stable release: v0.32.1

Released: March 4, 2026

For most users, our latest stable release is the recommended release. Install
the latest stable version with:

```
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

## Highlights

- **Plan Mode Enhancements**: Significant updates to Plan Mode, including the
  ability to open and modify plans in an external editor, adaptations for
  complex tasks with multi-select options, and integration tests for plan mode.
- **Agent and Steering Improvements**: The generalist agent has been enabled to
  enhance task delegation, model steering is now supported directly within the
  workspace, and contiguous parallel admission is enabled for `Kind.Agent`
  tools.
- **Interactive Shell**: Interactive shell autocompletion has been introduced,
  significantly enhancing the user experience.
- **Core Stability and Performance**: Extensions are now loaded in parallel,
  fetch timeouts have been increased, robust A2A streaming reassembly was
  implemented, and orphaned processes when terminal closes have been prevented.
- **Billing and Quota Handling**: Implemented G1 AI credits overage flow with
  billing telemetry and added support for quota error fallbacks across all
  authentication types.
